NIST-SIP v1.1 instant messaging (IM) tool
========================================

This is an example of how to use the JAIN-SIP 1.1 API to build  a client 
software.


IMPORTANT:

    - UDP and TCP support.

    - The IM user agent processes MESSAGE, INFO, OK, BYE, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY and REGISTER
      sip messages. There is support for ACK  but not yet implemented!
        
    - Client Authentication support (DIGEST). 
 
    - Buddies uploading, you can define your buddies in an XML file, they will be uploaded
      by the application, take a look at "buddies.xml" for more details! 

    - This application was successfully tested with Microsoft Messenger, Siemens user agent,
      Cisqo User Agent and our SIP proxy, registrar, presence server!

    - The XML supported formats for NOTIFY's body are "xpidf+xml"
      and "cpim-pidf+xml"!
    

Refer to docs/gov/nist/sip/instantmessaging/README.html for more informations on
how to use the client.
